    "text": "Welcome\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to work with categorical data using the forcats package in the tidyverse. Categorical data is essential in data analysis, and forcats provides powerful tools for managing factors.\n\nFunctions in Focus\nBefore we dive into the exercises, let’s introduce the key functions we will be working with and provide some guidance on their syntax:\n\nas.factor(): This function can convert a variable in another format into a factor variable. Syntax: `as.factor(nonfactor_variable)\nfct_expand(): This function is used to add new levels to a factor variable. Syntax: fct_expand(factor_variable, \"new_levels\")\nfct_collapse(): Use this function to group levels in a factor variable into broader categories. Syntax: fct_collapse(factor_variable, new_levels=c(\"old_leve1\", \"old_level2\"))\nfct_recode(): This function allows you to recode levels in a factor variable. Syntax: fct_recode(factor_variable, new_level=\"old_level\")\nfct_lump_n(): Use fct_lump_n() to lump levels in a factor variable into broader categories. Syntax: fct_lump(factor_variable, n=X)\nfct_infreq(): Use fct_infreq() to reorder the levels of the factor variable to follow the frequency of observations for different factor levels. Syntax: fct_infreq(factor_variable\n\nNow, let’s proceed to the exercises!"
