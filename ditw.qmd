Below are R tutorials developed for Lewis & Clark College's Data in the Wild data science course. They cover basic data wrangling, graphing with ggplot and inferential statistics. 

To use the tutorials, download the following .zip files and open in an R project on posit.cloud or R studio desktop. Each file contains modules which include a code-a-long, practice problems and homework. 

We recommend you begin with the code-a-long and refer to the code-a-long key to determine which commands to type in the code-a-long. Then, proceed to the homework and practice problems for more practice.
